# Combination Generator

This Python script generates all possible combinations of characters for various character sets. It can be used to create password candidates or explore the space of possible combinations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eatulrajput/combination-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd combination-generator
   ```

3. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python combination_generator.py
   ```

4. The script will print out combinations for different character sets:
   - 4-digit combinations using digits.
   - 4-character combinations using letters (both upper and lower case).
   - 4-character combinations using letters, digits, and punctuation.

   Additionally, it demonstrates how to increase the complexity to generate 8-character combinations.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs. You can change the character sets or adjust the length of the combinations. Keep in mind that generating and printing all combinations can be resource-intensive for longer lengths.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided as a simple educational tool and may not be suitable for production use. Always follow best practices for password generation and security in real-world applications.
